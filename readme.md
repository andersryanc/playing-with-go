# Playing With Go

I'm new to Go, but not to programming / web development in general. I've been a coder for over a decade (as of this writing) primarily using JavaScript/React/Node.JS. Go has been an interest of mine for a while now, but I haven't taken a good chunk of time to learn until now. This repo is mostly focused around developing a REST api but also includes some other random ideas and explorations along my journey to become better at writing Go.
